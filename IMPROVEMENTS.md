# Midna Improvements Tracker

## Core Functionality Issues

### Critical

- [ ] UTF-8 encoding issue when creating requirements files
- [ ] Unicode encoding errors in logging (BOM character handling)
- [ ] No validation of package existence before attempting installation
- [ ] Incorrect handling of malformed requirement specifications
- [ ] No proper handling of circular dependencies
- [ ] Comments incorrectly parsed as package names
- [ ] Incorrect parsing of complex version specifiers (e.g., !=, ~=)

### Package Management

- [ ] No support for package extras (e.g., pandas[excel])
- [ ] No handling of local path installations
- [ ] No support for editable installs (-e flag)
- [ ] No handling of meta-package dependencies
- [ ] No support for platform-specific requirements
- [ ] No handling of environment markers
- [ ] No support for constraints files (-c flag)
- [ ] Build tags not properly parsed (e.g., +mkl suffix)

## User Interface Improvements

### Visual Elements

- [ ] No progress bar/spinner during package installation
- [ ] No color coding in output (green for installed, yellow for updates)
- [ ] No visual indication of dependency relationships
- [ ] No clear differentiation between comments and package specifications
- [x] Help text still mentions "zap" instead of "midna" in examples

### Output Formatting

- [ ] Large requirements files show excessive output
- [ ] No smart output truncation or summarization
- [ ] No proper formatting for inline comments
- [ ] Environment variable references not clearly marked
- [ ] Character encoding issues with PowerShell output

## User Experience Enhancements

### Installation Process

- [ ] No indication of total installation size
- [ ] No feedback on installation progress
- [ ] No estimated installation time

- [ ] No cache management commands

### Dependency Management

- [ ] No bulk upgrade command for outdated packages
- [ ] No dependency resolution preview
- [ ] No handling of version conflicts
- [ ] No detection of conflicting dependencies
- [ ] No dependency tree visualization

## Security

- [ ] No hash verification support for secure installations
- [ ] No warning for potentially malicious packages
- [ ] No validation of package sources
- [ ] No support for private repository authentication
- [ ] No verification of package signatures

## Performance

- [ ] No parallel download support
- [ ] No caching of package metadata
- [ ] No optimization for repeated installations
- [ ] No lazy loading of package information
- [ ] No smart package download order

## Documentation

- [ ] Missing environment variables documentation
- [ ] No virtual environment usage examples
- [ ] No troubleshooting section
- [ ] Lack of API documentation
- [ ] Missing examples for common use cases
- [ ] No documentation for error codes
